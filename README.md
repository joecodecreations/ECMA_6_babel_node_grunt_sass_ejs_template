# ECMAScript 6 using Babel (as well as Grunt, SCSS, NodeJS/Express Server utilizing EJS)

I use this base template for getting up and running for writing ECMAScript/babel scripts

* Babel - ECMAScript 6
* HTML5
* Uglify
* Grunt
* SASS globbing, minification to style sheet
* NodeJS / Express web server
* Watches files for changes

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`

2. Install nodemon globally `npm install -g nodemon`

3. Start server by running `nodemon server.js`

Open another instance in your terminal and run `grunt watcher`
for style/js changes.
